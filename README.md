this project was given by an internship recruiter as an assessment, i have accomplished the task using neural network model and has data cleaning, analysing the insights
Business Context:
This case requires trainees to develop a model for predicting fraudulent transactions for a 
financial company and use insights from the model to develop an actionable plan. Data for the 
case is available in CSV format having 6362620 rows and 10 columns.
Candidates can use whatever method they wish to develop their machine learning model. 
Following usual model development procedures, the model would be estimated on the 
calibration data and tested on the validation data. This case requires both statistical analysis and 
creativity/judgment. We recommend you spend time on both fine-tuning and interpreting the 
results of your machine learning model.

 Data Cleaning:
Missing Values: We'll inspect the dataset for any missing values and handle them appropriately, either by filling them with a suitable value (e.g., mean, median) or by removing the rows/columns if necessary.
Outliers: We'll identify and handle outliers using methods like Z-scores or the IQR method. Outliers can be capped, removed, or transformed based on their impact.
Multi-Collinearity: We'll check for multicollinearity among features using correlation matrices or Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Highly correlated variables may be dropped or combined to reduce redundancy.
